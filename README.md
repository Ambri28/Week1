# 🌲 Week 1: Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning

## 📅 Timeline: Week 1 – Planning, Data Collection & Preprocessing

### ✅ Objectives
- Define project goals and setup
- Collect and explore dataset
- Preprocess image data for deep learning model

---

## 🧠 Tasks Completed

### 1. 🔧 Project Setup
- Initialized Git repository
- Installed required libraries:
  - Python 3.x
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- Created project structure:

### 2. 📚 Research & Planning
- Reviewed existing approaches in forest fire detection
- Decided to use a CNN-based model for image classification
- Identified potential datasets on Kaggle and open repositories

### 3. 🗃️ Dataset Collection
- Collected labeled forest fire images (Fire / No Fire)
- Sources: Kaggle, custom image scraping
- Organized dataset into directories:

### 4. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Resized images to a standard size (e.g., 128x128)
- Normalized pixel values between 0 and 1
- Applied data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)
- Saved preprocessed images for model training

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧩 Deliverables
- Initial dataset (organized & cleaned)
- Preprocessing pipeline (`src/preprocessing.py`)
- Jupyter notebook for EDA and data visualization
- Updated project README and requirements.txt

---

## 📌 Next Week
- Build CNN model architecture
- Begin training on preprocessed dataset
- Tune hyperparameters for better performance
